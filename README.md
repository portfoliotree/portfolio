# Portfolio [![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/portfoliotree/portfolio/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/portfoliotree/portfolio/actions/workflows/go.yml)

This module contains quantitative portfolio analysis equations, portfolio back-testing, and asset data organization/cleaning data structures.

This module will continue to work on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

While our main focus is our website.
We value community engagement and will put effort into reviewing contributions and fixing issues on this repository.

**Note, the API is not stable and will continue to change without notice until version v1.0**
